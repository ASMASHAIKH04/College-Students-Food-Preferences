# Food Choices Analysis using Python

This notebook performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a food choices dataset, featuring the following steps:

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**: Load the dataset, inspect its structure, and identify missing values and duplicates.

2. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values by filling with mean or mode, drop irrelevant columns, and convert data types as necessary.

3. **Visualization**: 
   - Create bar plots, pie charts, and histograms to analyze distributions of various factors such as GPA, gender, coffee consumption, and comfort food.
   - Use count plots to assess relationships between categorical variables like eating habits and exercise frequency.

4. **Statistical Analysis**: Perform summary statistics and visualize weight distribution with box plots.

5. **Exporting Results**: Save the cleaned dataset and most popular food items to CSV files for further analysis.

This workflow provides insights into student food choices and their correlations with lifestyle factors.
